# CS455_Algorithm
## Introduction: 
### This Project is a Demonstration of the manual process and python code implementation of using DFS on a real-life application such as Robots.

#### The applications DFS â€“ Depth First Search can be performed on the Legged Robot moving on a street. 

#### Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a depth ward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration. 

#### We have this scenarios:

### The First Scenario Without wheel (Legged Robot) on a Clear Route (Street, Highway): 

#### When there is a clear route to follow, we start from the opening or the beginning of the street and go move through the maze or in the real-life applications on the street once cell at a time.

### The First Scenario Without wheel (Legged Robot) on an Unclear Route (Hotel, Hospital): 

The Legged Robot can only move one cell at a time in this case the ball is as the Robot.

### The Second Scenario With wheel (Wheeled Robot) on an Unclear Route (Hotel, Hospital): 

The second scenario with wheel on an unclear route has more options compared to the clear route since we try every option till we reach the goal(destination)

### The Second Scenario With wheel (Wheeled Robot) on a Clear Route (Street, Highway): 

On clear route we have less trial and error to reach the desired destination
